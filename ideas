Questions

1 - should i create a binary tree of the rooms as i receive them
		pros:
			validation would be made quicker and easier
		cons:
			might not need to be validated which means it could be a waste of
			space and/or time

2 - how to store the paths that are created. must be efficient

still need to make the queue to store each successive room. there are
going to be a lot of data structures in this, maybe try to limit that for
time? or would it be fine to use a lot and it would be faster because of the
structures choosen



int		i;
int		room;
int		#ofrooms;

#ofrooms = 8;
firsthalf = #ofrooms / 2;
room = 0;
i = 0;
while (i < #ofrooms)
{
	//first look through the rooms by column
	m[column][room];
	++i;
}
while (i < #ofrooms)
{
	//then (for the second half) look through the room by row
	m[room][row];
	++i;
}
